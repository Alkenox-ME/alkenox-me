        <h1>Sound Design</h1>
        Sound Design matters. It is what connects your audience to your product. Whether it is
        designing the dings and whistles on your app, getting the right sounds for your game-scape,
        sound is what brings your audience into your creation and connects them to it. Whatever your
        needs, we can help! Hard effect, soft effect, foley and soundscaping for Film, Television,
        and Games. Branded Sound Icons for a project or company. Interactive projects ranging from
        audio navigation for the blind to the aesthetics of your user interface are welcome.

        <h2>Film, Television, Games, & Apps</h2>
        We enjoy making imerssive soundscapes that glue to each other and to the picture on screen.

        <h2>Branded Sound Crafting</h2>
        As a brand, you want to make sure that you are not only seen but heard. We all know
        LionsGate from the roar of the lion. We even know when it is that particular lion being
        played. We know the motif of the Warner Brother's trumpets or the chime of a Mac computer
        booting up. Why should n0t your brand have the same capability?
