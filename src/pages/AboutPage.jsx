          Alkenox Media & Entertainment is an independent media production company, officially
          founded in 2018, in the greater Atlanta area. At its core, we are a brother and sister
          team that, much like yin and yang, find our strengths to be complimentary. After working
          with each other on various projects in video production, animation, and web development
          over a five year span, Alkenox-ME was the next logical step.

          Sight and Sound are the backbone of the user experience. Since one or both of these are
          always being stimulated, they are very important parts of sensory marketing and
          branding. Much like the opening sounds and images to a movie, you want your audience to
          feel the same kind of emotional connection with your business.
