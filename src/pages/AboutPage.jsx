        Alkenox Media & Entertainment is an independent media production
        company, officially founded in 2018, in the greater Atlanta area. At its
        core, we are a brother and sister team that, much like yin and yang,
        find our strengths to be complimentary. After working with each other on
        various projects in video production, animation, and web development
        over a five year span, Alkenox-ME was the next logical step.

        Sight and Sound are the backbone of the user experience. Since one or
        both of these are always being stimulated, they are very important parts
        of sensory marketing and branding. Much like the opening sounds and
        images to a movie, you want your audience to feel the same kind of
        emotional connection with your business.
