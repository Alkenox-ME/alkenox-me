                        Alkenox Media & Entertainment is an independent branding and content creation company with a
                        focus on the digital experience. We create tailored, edgy, and untraditionally entertaining
                        content for  the promotion of your brand and it's products or services.

                    <P>
                        The main goal of content is to inform or educate, to entertain, give some form of emotional
                        satisfaction, or to become socially valuable (ie. clickable, relatable, and shareable) while
                        keeping your audience’s attention and motivating their interaction with your brand. By
                        connecting your brand with your audience through added entertainment value, you give them a
                        memory with your brand attached, that they want to keep. This incites a stronger response and a
                        desire to interact with your brand.

                    <P>
                        Our goal is to indirectly advertise your business through branded stories that people want to
                        see because they are entertaining, fun, and out of the box from what they would normally expect.
