                    Branding, marketing and advertising are all tools that work together to help promote your business.
                    Branding is what your company believes in, it's reason for being, and how customers feel about your
                    business and products. Marketing embraces strategies to build awareness of your company's products
                    and services, while promoting and protecting the brand. Advertising is focused mostly on acquiring
                    customers and driving sales.

                    strategy in place to help promote long-term success. Make sure your company has a strong message and
                    focus that will resonate with customers. Once you are clear on your company's reason for being,

                        interact with your brand. In this way, your website will also give you a way to measure the
                        results of your campaigns.
